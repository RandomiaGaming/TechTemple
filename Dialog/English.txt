techTemple_wallBounces0= In order to complete this screen you will need to master wall bounces.
To preform a wall bounce simply walljump while dashing upwards.
This will give Madeline a boost of upwards momentum and allow her to reach high ledges like this one.
Keep in mind that just like regular jumps the longer you hold the jump button the higher Madeline will bounce.
techTemple_wallBounces1= Congratulations, you did a wall bounce!
For this next section you will need to line up Madeline before wall bouncing.
Pro Tip: If Madeline dashes into the corner of a block the game will automatically push her arround it.
This means that most of the time you want to be closer to the wall instead of farther away.
techTemple_wallBounces2= That's it you have learned the basics of wall bouncing!
Now for the real challenge... Good Luck!
techTemple_wallBounces3= This one takes most people awhile but don't be discurraged. You have come so far and you are almost there!
Don't give up! You got this!
techTemple_wallBounces4= Congratulations you have now mastered wall bouncing!
Now to learn neutral jumps...
techTemple_neutralJumps0= This next section would be impossible if not for a glitch called the neutral jump.
To neutral jump you first hold a direction then release that direction just long enough to walljump then immediatly after hold a direction again.
If done correctly Madeline will walljump away from the wall and then land back on the wall higher than she started.
If you are flying too far away from the wall then you are probably still holding a direction when you walljump.
If you aren't landing higher than you started you are probably waiting too long after walljumping to hold a direction again.
The goal is to hold left or right as much as possible and only to release them at the moment you press jump.
